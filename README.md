### 2. LoanWise: A system that aids smart lending and borrowing decisions
**Code**: [LoanWise: A system that aids smart lending and borrowing decisions](https://github.com/sweta4340/ENGR_5520G_G5)

**Description**: A system that aids smart lending decisions based on insightful data. The aim for our project is to build loan amount prediction system powered by machine learning which helps to a borrower to assess his eligibility for a loan amount based on his personal and financial information. This system is also useful for lenders to visualize and analyze various factors influencing loan approval decisions, behavior and the associated risk.

**Key Features**:  
- **Peer-to-Peer Lending Transparency**: Borrowers receive clear loan estimates and interest rates.  
- **Automated Decision-Making**: Faster loan approvals for lenders.  
- **Risk Analysis for Lenders**: Insights into funding profitability and associated risks.

**Skills**: Data cleaning, Data analysis, Feature, Engineering, Data visualization, Machine Learning, PowerBI, Github workflows

**Technology**: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting

**Results**: Achieving an R¬≤ score of 98% in determining Interest rate, R¬≤ score of 91% for determining loan amount, R¬≤ score of 81% in determining Expected Returns and R¬≤ score of 83% for determing default probability.

### 3. Generalizing speech emotion detection: Multimodal and multidataset approach
**Code**: [Speech Emotion Detection](https://github.com/sweta4340/Speech_Emotion_Detection)

**Description**: A data-driven system for analyzing emotions from speech, leveraging AI to recognize and categorize emotions like happiness, disgust, sadness, surprise, and neutrality from audio data. This project focuses on building a robust system that captures the variability in speech data caused by speaker diversity, environmental conditions, and audio quality, aiming to improve the generalization and reliability of emotion detection models.

**Key Features**:  
- **Multimodal Approach**: Combines diverse speech emotion datasets and applies a multimodal approach for better generalization.
- **Data Augmentation**: Utilizes data augmentation techniques to enhance model robustness by increasing training dataset variability.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extracts key audio features (MFCC, chroma, spectral contrast) to represent emotions effectively.
- **Ensemble Learning**: Applies ensemble learning techniques, specifically combining SVM and RF, to achieve high accuracy in emotion classification.

**Skills**: Speech emotion recognition, Data augmentation, Feature extraction, Machine learning model comparison, Model evaluation
