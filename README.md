üëã Hello, I'm Sweta Patel, a passionate data engineer with expertise in analytics, software engineering, and project management.

My love for data started back in college when I first discovered how databases store, manage, and transform raw information into meaningful insights. I was fascinated by how data isn‚Äôt just numbers‚Äîit tells stories and drives decisions. That curiosity stuck with me, pushing me to explore deeper and build data-driven solutions that actually make an impact.

üéì With over 2.5 years of experience across both the healthcare and banking sectors, I‚Äôve designed and optimized ETL pipelines, built data migration frameworks, and implemented cloud-native architectures that improve performance, reliability, and compliance.
Currently at EY Technology Solutions, I work on large-scale data migration and transformation projects for one of Canada‚Äôs top banks, where I‚Äôve helped streamline workflows and reduce processing time by over 30%. Before this, I led healthcare data initiatives at L&T Technology Services, building Python-based ETL pipelines and Power BI dashboards that enabled clinical teams to make faster, data-driven decisions.

üöÄ I believe data isn‚Äôt just numbers‚Äîit‚Äôs the key to smarter decision-making, optimized processes, and groundbreaking innovations. I‚Äôm always eager to connect with fellow data enthusiasts, engineers, and visionaries to exchange ideas, collaborate, and push the boundaries of data-driven transformation.
